# odin-recipes
This project will allow me to create a simple website recipe. 
So far I have learned to create a repository within github
as well as the command line. 

In addition to learning how to create a repository, and cloning it to my
local machine I have also learned about the importance of good commit messages
 and how important they are to the workflow.
